# AtliQ Hospitality Analysis-PowerBI

AtliQ Grands has been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years and has lost its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move and ineffective decision-making, Atliq Grands wants to incorporate data through a power bi dashboard to regain its market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights. Their revenue teams had decided to hire 3rd party provider to give insights from historical data.

#Recommendations:

ADR Stability: The Average Daily Rate (ADR) has stayed steady, showing a consistent pricing approach. However, there’s an opportunity to use dynamic pricing based on weekdays and weekends. This could help increase revenue by adjusting prices according to demand.
Occupancy Rate: AtliQ Grands' properties maintain a solid occupancy rate of 57%, indicating effective room utilization. However, there's room to boost occupancy, particularly during off-peak periods, to further maximize revenue potential.
Average Rating: With an average guest rating of 3.62, AtliQ Grands is providing a positive guest experience. To keep this up, it’s important to continue improving service and listen to guest feedback to maintain and raise this rating.
